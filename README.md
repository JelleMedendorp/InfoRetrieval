# InfoRetrieval
Building an Information retrieval system for the TREC-Covid data

The code of our SMART search system can be found in main.py and the helper.py

The data we used for our results is the TREC-COVID release of round 1, from 10/04/2020 (https://github.com/allenai/cord19). In here is a .csv file with the metadata of roughly 51 thousand documents that we used.

Our results are stored in the folder Evaluations, with one file containing the results when we looked at the queries, the other is when we looked at the question which belonged to these queries. 
Results are calculated with the official tool from NIST/TREC (https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval/)

The queries and questions for round one can be found in the file 'topics-rnd1.xml'

All other files are generated by the code in main.py and helper.py, or files we used for testing our search system.
